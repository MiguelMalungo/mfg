# Miguel Ferraz Guedes Website

This is a clone of the website [https://theoneupwardspiral.wixsite.com/mysite](https://theoneupwardspiral.wixsite.com/mysite) built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## Important Notes

### Video for Store Page
The store page is designed with a full-page video hero section with a black overlay at 40% opacity and white title text on top. To add your video:

1. Place your video file in the `public` directory
2. Name it `video-placeholder.mp4`
3. The video will automatically be displayed with the proper styling

### Placeholder Images
All image placeholders are currently represented by gray boxes. Replace these with your actual images by updating the components in the respective page files.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
