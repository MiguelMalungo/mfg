# 3D Models Required

This component requires three 3D model files to function:

1. **lens.glb** - For lens mode
2. **bar.glb** - For bar mode
3. **cube.glb** - For cube mode

You need to place these .glb files in this directory (`public/assets/3d/`).

You can find example models in the component's original repository or create your own using Blender or other 3D modeling software.

Without these files, the FluidGlass component will not work.
