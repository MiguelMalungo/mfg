# Video Placeholder

The store page is designed to display a full-screen video in the hero section. You'll need to add your own video file here named `video-placeholder.mp4`.

## Instructions:

1. Place your video file in this public directory
2. Name it `video-placeholder.mp4`
3. The video will automatically be displayed with a 40% black overlay and the "WORK/STORE" title on top, as requested

If you don't add a video file, the page will still work but the video section will appear as a black background with the title.
